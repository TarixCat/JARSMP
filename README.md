# JARSMP
This is an actually done plugin, has been worked on over the last two years to help me learn how to code Minecraft plugins. Nothing to note really.

**Note:** Original versions going from 0.0.1 to 0.9.0 are all "lost" versions which at time contained features which no longer exists.
Due to the rework and improvements these lost features may be reintroduced in the future.
